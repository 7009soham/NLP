# Neural Networks for NLP

## Introduction

Deep learning has revolutionized NLP by enabling models to learn complex patterns and representations directly from data.

## Why Neural Networks for NLP?

1. **Automatic Feature Learning**: No need for manual feature engineering
2. **Handle Complex Patterns**: Capture long-range dependencies and context
3. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks
4. **State-of-the-art Performance**: Best results on most NLP benchmarks

## Common Architectures

### Feedforward Neural Networks
- Basic architecture for text classification
- Requires fixed-size input (e.g., averaged word embeddings)
- Fast but limited sequential modeling

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Process sequences of variable length
- Maintain hidden state across time steps
- Challenges: vanishing/exploding gradients

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Addresses RNN gradient problems
- Uses gates to control information flow
- Better at capturing long-range dependencies

### GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- Simplified version of LSTM
- Fewer parameters, faster training
- Similar performance to LSTM

### CNN for Text
- Apply convolutional filters to text
- Fast and parallelizable
- Good for capturing local patterns

## Applications

- Text classification (sentiment, topic)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Machine translation
- Text generation
- Question answering
- Language modeling

## Key Concepts

### Embedding Layer
- Converts word indices to dense vectors
- Can use pre-trained or learned embeddings

### Sequence Modeling
- Process text as a sequence
- Maintain context and order information

### Attention Mechanism
- Focus on relevant parts of input
- Improves long sequence handling

## Getting Started

Start with simple feedforward networks, then progress to RNNs and LSTMs!

# 02. Text Preprocessing

## Overview
Text preprocessing is a crucial step in NLP that transforms raw text into a clean, standardized format suitable for analysis and modeling.

## Topics

### 2.1 Text Cleaning
- Removing HTML tags and special characters
- Handling whitespace and formatting
- Case normalization (lowercase/uppercase)
- Removing URLs and email addresses

### 2.2 Tokenization
- Word tokenization
- Sentence tokenization
- Subword tokenization (BPE, WordPiece)
- Character tokenization

### 2.3 Normalization Techniques
- Stemming (Porter, Lancaster, Snowball)
- Lemmatization
- Handling contractions and abbreviations
- Spell checking and correction

### 2.4 Stop Words and Filtering
- Stop words removal
- Frequency-based filtering
- Noise removal
- Punctuation handling

### 2.5 Advanced Preprocessing
- N-grams generation
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- Text vectorization basics
- Handling different languages

## Learning Objectives
- Master essential text cleaning techniques
- Understand different tokenization methods
- Apply normalization techniques appropriately
- Build robust preprocessing pipelines

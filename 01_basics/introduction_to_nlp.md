# Introduction to NLP

## What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way.

## Key Applications

- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone of text
- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT
- **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries of long documents
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying people, places, organizations in text
- **Question Answering**: Systems that can answer questions about text
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting speech to text

## Challenges in NLP

1. **Ambiguity**: Words and sentences can have multiple meanings
2. **Context**: Understanding requires contextual knowledge
3. **Variation**: Language has many dialects, styles, and forms
4. **Creativity**: Humans use metaphors, sarcasm, and idioms
5. **Knowledge**: Understanding often requires world knowledge

## The NLP Pipeline

```
Raw Text → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Model → Output
```

1. **Text Collection**: Gather text data
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize text
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert text to numerical representations
4. **Model Training**: Train ML/DL models
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance
6. **Deployment**: Use model in production
